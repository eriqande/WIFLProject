<!-- README.md is generated from README.Rmd. Please edit that file -->

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  fig.path = "readme-figs/"
)
```

You can start writing text in there winnie.

Then Knit it with the Knit button, and be sure to commit the resulting README.md file too!

If you want to add R code in a code block, you can do it like this:
```{r}
x <- 1:10
y <- x^2
```

Let's get you set up with some data in here that you can start to work with too. 

Talk to Eric or Kristen about that if you need some help!
